## Summary
### Airbnb is an online platform that allows property owners, or hosts, to rent accommodations to travelers. The company takes a percentage of a host's booking through a split fee paid by the host and guest or a host-only fee.
#### In recent years, Berlin has encountered a number of challenges due to the rise of Airbnb and other short-term rental platforms. To address these issues, the city has introduced strict regulations, restricting short-term rentals in certain neighborhoods. These measures have sparked concerns about the availability of affordable housing for long-term residents and the overall impact on the housing market. Additionally, the growing demand for short-term stays has increased pressure on urban infrastructure, including public transportation, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of this trend. The situation remains complex and continues to be the focus of public debate and policy discussions.
